# JoomJCommentsPlugin
With this plugin you will be able to display the amount of comments near the thumbnail of an image or a category if you use the comment component [JComments](http://www.joomlatune.com/jcomments.html) and the JoomGallery Modul [JoomJComments](https://github.com/JoomGalleryfriends/JoomJComments) on your site.

With this plugin enabled the JComments comments will also be used for the toplist 'last commented' of JoomGallery.
